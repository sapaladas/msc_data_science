    "For the final project you will use <b>Apache Spark</b> to execute queries on datasets.<br>\n",
    "There are 2 basic APIs for query execution, the <a href=\"https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.4.4/rdd-programming-guide.html\">RDD API</a> and the <a href=\"https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.4.4/sql-programming-guide.html\">DataFrame/SQL API</a>.<br>\n",
    "  To download the dataset you need to execute the following commands in your master machine:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `wget https://www.dropbox.com/s/yprrbtqhy0fi6os/datasets.tar.gz?dl=0`\n",
    "- `mv datasets.tar.gz?dl=0 datasets.tar.gz`\n",
    "- `tar -xzf datasets.tar.gz`\n",
    "\n",
    "The files are in csv format and executing queries in this format is not efficient.<br>\n",
    "To optimize data access, databases traditionally load data into a specific designed binary formats.<br>\n",
    "Spark has a similar approach too and we can convert datasets to a special format named \"parquet\".<br>\n",
    "The parquet file format has major benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Has smaller footprint in memory and disk and therefore optimizes I/O, reducing execution time*\n",
    "2. *Maintains additional information, such as statistics on the dataset, which helps on more efficient processing*\n",
    "\n",
    "The parquet file format is a columnar file format, you can read more about it <a href=\"https://parquet.apache.org/\">here</a>.<br>\n",
    "On how to read and write parquet files you can find information <a href=\"https://spark.apache.org/docs/2.4.4/sql-data-sources-parquet.html\">here</a>.\n",

    "<p style='text-align: justify;'>According to the graph, it is obvious that we have a clear winner in terms of execution times. Using Spark SQL on parquet files to execute the queries seems to be the fastest way for someone to proceed with. On the other hand, MapReduce using the RDD API seems to be by far the slowest and less efficient choice.</p>"
