Good salary and also right principles. *separator* Sometime the env van be hard for new members.,5,"Sep 11, 2022"
"- The Amazon science community has lots of smart, hardworking, and nice people, which makes collaborating easier and you can learn from many people. - Project impact always aims to be clear and tangible, so you won't be stuck on dead-end projects that no one cares about. - WLB is usually pretty good and most teams are flexible about WFH. - Very strong customer-focused business philosophy.. *separator* - The perks and benefits are subpar in comparison to peers, e.g. very low 401k match, no fun perks like free food or wellness subsidy. - URA/stack ranking makes work environment more stressful. Sometimes people work too hard. - Way too many leadership principles..",4,"Oct 19, 2022"

"- I heard all the time before joining that work culture is not that great, work life balance is very bad, but that was mostly from SDE at AWS, I cant say anything about that right now, but joining Amazon.com as DS, I am doing exactly what I was hired for with a nice team who respects work life balance and you time. - Onboarding process is so well designed. - Work Life Balance - Pay is good compared to industry standards.. *separator* - Well, sometimes, thing dont seem very logical, the company will pay you $300 for extra luggage on flight, but you cant use that $300 to just UPS the stuff (while relocation). Such policies does not make a lot of sense. - Other than that, all good for me as of now..",5,"Aug 29, 2022"

"If you like the feel of a start up but with more security and some of the perks of working for a large org, you'll like it at Amazon. Although it really depends on you where you work and what org you work in. Some places, like Fashion or Ads, are amazing. Management listens and is truly invested in their staff. Other organizations are incredibly toxic. So it's a roll of the dice. The pay is ok. They try to keep you there by inflating your compensation package with stock that vests slowly over a 4 year time period. But the base pay runs between average to slightly below average. As a data scientist (or any tech role), you'll likely have total access to the complete AWS suite of tools, but you'll have to monitor your usage as every group is given a budget for an AWS bill. Don't expect to have access to industry standard tools like Stata, SPSS, etc.. *separator* Amazon still tries to pretend it's a startup but when you employ 50,000+ people that doesn't always work well. The systems are often broken or unusable and you are very much thrown into the deep end to figure out how to do anything. There's no broad support. As a data scientist, I was lucky that I had a strong SDE background so I knew how to spin up and manage my own EMR clusters or how to work with a bunch of different databases to gather results using different code languages, as well as knowing both R and Python, but most people don't have that kind of background. And despite having 3 job families for scientists (Data, Research, and Applied), the role guidelines aren't always followed so sometimes Data or Research scientists end up doing the work of an Applied Scientist. It's ridiculously competitive. Some orgs are able to harness that and direct it in healthy ways, allowing people to grow and help those around them. Other orgs will weaponize that competitiveness and create a toxic environment, where everyone is either stabbing you in the back or throwing you under the bus. Regardless of your org though, management will put unrealistic expectations on you and just expect you to perform at the very peak of your peers; which means you have to be a super performer 24/7. Otherwise, you'll get a poor review and will be fired, put on an improvement plan (which most folks never recover from and are eventually fired or quit within a year), or given a verbal warning and no compensation review (salary adjustments only happen once a year for everyone at the same time). Management also pays lip service to DEI but most of it is smoke and mirrors. They don't take the time to listen to marginalized communities and when people speak up about injustice, they are quickly silenced. And the internal affinity groups (also known as ERGs in the larger tech world) are gagged by the business. They are supposed to advocate for their communities but most of them aren't allowed to do so, especially if it rocks the boat too much. If you are a cishet white male, you'll fit in fine. For everyone else, it's a roll of the dice..",2,"May 22, 2022"

If you really cannot find one, the environment allows you to freely propose with leadership to support and provide resources.. *separator* - Hard to maintain work-life balance: Late-night/morning meetings, last minute ad-hoc priorities, and inflexible timeline, etc. - Constant changes in leadership or focus: Might not apply to every org, but moving fast means sacrificing some of the spent effort and shifting focus on 'immediately important' stuff. - Competition between teams: It does not necessarily become unhealthy, but if it does, usually is because of work in similar nature competing for visibility/implementation..",4,"Jul 16, 2021"

"I worked for AWS Professional Services, the consulting arm of Amazon Web Services. * AWS invests a LOT in your education. 6 weeks of just onboarding, including AWS paying for certification training classes and certification exames * Access to internal AWS accounts makes it easy to experiment and learn * My coworkers were brilliant, and I learned a lot from them * Access to unique customer challenges and datasets * Pay was great, 30% higher than what I was making in my previous job * For a while, some of the travel is great. I got to visit a few cities around the U.S. and even travel internationally * Work-life balanced is manageable. Could be a lot better if there weren't so many time-sucking unnecessary internal processes, but it's not nearly as bad as Amazon's reputation if you google ""Amazon work-life balance"". *separator* * Amazon is enormous, and as bureaucratic as you'd guess based on that size. I probably bookmarked 200 well-meaning internal sites / tools my first week. * Gender diversity was awful on my team. I think it was something like 80 employees, 3 women. * Travel in AWS Professional Services is a lot more manageable than at management consultancies, but it can still wear you down. I'd say on average I got about 10 days notice before traveling * Internal communication tools are awful.

Typically a project lasts 4 months, so time varies. * Resource management is pretty poor sometimes. Meaning they have a difficult time matching people with the right skills to the right projects. Getting a ""good"" project which you can make an impact on is sometimes luck. * In professional services your team is typically scattered across the country. Hence, you do feel isolated at times. * Some projects lack proper project management. E.g. A project manger can only spend 4 hours a week on your project.

"I hear this is certainly not true for every team, but I think my team is great and I’m very happy at Amazon. - My work life balance is great. I hardly ever have to work more than 40 hours/week. The few times that I do, I don’t particularly mind since I rarely have to. - My team and manager are really chill. Nobody cares when I get to the office, when I leave, or exactly how many hours I was there. I’m certainly expected to get my work done, but I feel like I have a lot of freedom to work on my projects however I’d like. I also work from home about once a week. - This is especially true for Amazon Web Services (where I work) but I feel fortunate that I can learn how to use all the services on AWS for free. My field uses AWS pretty extensively, but it’s normally pretty expensive if you want to use it a lot. We get it all for free and we use it a lot in our everyday work, so I feel pretty lucky to be able to learn it.. *separator* - Compared to other tech companies Amazon is undoubtedly very cheap. We have to pay for all of our own food, the food is expensive, and it’s also mediocre. Parking isn’t even free. Our benefits are okay but not as good as other tech companies. Our office space looks fine but pretty minimalist. I find this to be minor in the grand scheme of things but it’s definitely noticeable. - I dislike being on-call. I’m on call for a week at a time about once every two months. During that time you’re handed a pager and you have to be available 24/7 for issues. This could potentially be on a random weekend afternoon, 8 am in the morning, or worst of all, the dreaded 3 am pager ringing. Fortunately I’m not on-call all that often so I just suck it up and deal with it whenever it rolls around..",5,"Jun 6, 2019"

"What are the pros and cons of working at Amazon? I recently left Amazon to start my own venture. I was there for a little under 2 years. The answer to your question will of course, vary by the person answering but in my perspective, it was the highlight of my career. It is a tough and demanding environment but I truly enjoyed my work and my time there, Below are the pros and cons based on my experience Pros 1. Big problems - At Amazon, no problem is pushed aside as too hard to solve. In fact, they go after the really hard and insolvable problems and then throw talent, time and resources towards solving them. In my time there, pretty much every team I worked with was solving a ""holy grail"" problem in their field and actually making progress towards it. There is no dearth of interesting projects, teams or ideas to work on. 2. Structure and thinking - There is a lot of document writing at Amazon, in case you have not heard. While some people do not like that part of the job much, I think the required meetings and documents force every employee to truly think about their job and what they are doing. Producing the write-ups and getting them ready to face up to a room of very detailed scrutiny and questioning forces you to think through every aspect of your business. it is really a very valuable skill that Amazon does a great job of developing. 3. Ownership - Amazon treats you like an owner - a grown up. You have a job to do and you are empowered to do it. There are checks and balances, of course, but you truly do own your business. You make the assessments, take the risks, justify your decisions and ultimately reap the benefits or learn from your mistakes and move on. There are not many fall-backs and layers to catch you if you are not moving your business forward. Not a lot of finger poitning for failures either, that I saw. In fact, I would say that if you do not act like an owner, you will not be successful at Amazon. You have to embrace the responsibility and run with it. 4. Smart People - You'll hear this a lot and personally, I think some of the talk is overblown but Amazon does indeed have some very, very smart and talented people working there. I know its a cliche, but I did learn a lot from most people I worked with there - and again, I say, most, not all :-) are just genuinely nice people. I would work again with these people without hesitation. I think the leadership there is especially great - just really smart, experienced people with sharp instincts, great insights and lots of ambition. It was really fun working with the folks I did.. *separator* What are the pros and cons of working at Amazon? I recently left Amazon to start my own venture. I was there for a little under 2 years.

I would work again with these people without hesitation. I think the leadership there is especially great - just really smart, experienced people with sharp instincts, great insights and lots of ambition. It was really fun working with the folks I did. Cons 1. Structure and documentation - What I said above about structure and documentation, while its great to create clarity and shape your thinking, it can get in the way of actually doing your work. Everybody at Amazon is juggling so much and constantly writing high quality documents can get exhausting. The secret here, as in any job, is to balance the strategic against the operational and prioritize ruthlessly. I cannot say I was always effective at it - but I tried till my last day and now have the benefit of hind sight as well :-) 2. Culture - I think some people could have a tough time adjusting to the culture - its tough, expectations are high and there is not always a lot of hand holding ( in fact, it would be very rare). I think you have to embrace or at least accept it and focus on the positives. Your team makes a huge difference - so hopefully you're lucky and end up with a great manager and great team mates. If you're looking for free food and onsite massages - you certainly will be disappointed. You can end up overworked and resentful if you are not good at prioritizing your work and your life and making trade-offs. 3. People/Politics - I started to see a lot of the ""we are the best in the world"" mentality start to show up. I don't believe that everyone that works at Amazon is a genius and seeing that attitude crop up every now and then was annoying. Every company has inside politics and even though Amazon tries really hard to believe there is no politics, there is certainly that to deal with. No more than any other company that I can tell, but it can get frustrating when you're working so hard and so long to get derailed by that kind of thing. So there you have it - overall I loved my time at Amazon. I was exhausted (in a very good way) every day but couldn't wait to go back and keep making progress. I was lucky to have a great team, a really interesting area to work on and some awesome problems to tackle. some of the talk is overblown but Amazon does indeed have some very, very smart and talented people working there. I know its a cliche, but I did learn a lot.",4,"Apr 19, 2022"

"- Amazon name and title on resume. *separator* - Total metric overload: entire meetings go by with staff quoting dozens of metrics and people just going along as if an actual meeting is taking place.

If you don't promote your own work you won't get recognition. The Culture is hollow: people are nice and friendly but there is a dramatic cavity where there should be enthusiasm and joy. Friday night get togethers? nope. Coworkers hanging out during work? nope. People are friendly yes, respectful yes, but absolutely soulless compared to other tech companies. - Unfortuanately Hierarchial and not flat.
