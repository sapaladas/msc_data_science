Hard work and a long time commitment are required, but the compensation policy and transparency are really bad. Experience is heavily affected by team and managers. You can control it to some extent, but that means saying no and learning what is/is not important. Pressure to deliver and learn topics quickly. Part of evil empire that only cares about profits.
